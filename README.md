# bluetooth-door-lock
## Firmware
Door Lock implemented with a Feedback Servo, an Adafruit nRF52840 Express, an Adafruit Servo Featherwing, and some 3D printed parts..

## UI
User-facing software implemented as an iPhone app with SwiftUI, CoreBluetooth and SQLite. With full backgrounding support for the ultimate seamless experience.

The app uses [Tuist](https://tuist.io) instead of Xcode project management as an experiment for work, and also because I don't want to commit a bunch of semi-sensitive information from Xcodeproj files.
